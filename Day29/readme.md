1. Events are the static objects handled to synchronize two or concurrently active processes. One process will trigger and the other process will wait.
   
2.-> This is used for the event to trigger.
3. @ This is used for the event to wait.
4. Another operator to wait is to use wait(variable. triggered) this has some advantages compared to @ operator.
5. First if the event triggers a later wait then the event does not happen but if we use wait(variable. triggered) event happens.
