1. The primary purpose of a function is to return a value that can be used in the expression and cannot consume simulation time.
2. A task may or may not consume simulation time return output or inout arguments.
3. Function and tasks are used to reuse the code.
4. Functions cannot enable tasks, but tasks can enable other tasks and functions.
